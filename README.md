# walk-forward-Backtesting-engine
A lightweight backtesting engine built to evaluate trading ideas under realistic time constraints. Uses a walk-forward setup with lagged signals to avoid lookahead bias, compares strategies against buy-and-hold and random baselines, and includes parameter sweeps to test robustness rather than relying on a single configuration.
